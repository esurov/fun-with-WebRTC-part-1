# Let's Have Fun With WebRTC - Part 1
Code sample from my [first article about WebRTC](nschoe.com).  
You will find:

- [A simple mirror view](github.com/nschoe) to learn about the `MediaCapture` / `MediaStream` API and `getUserMedia()` function.
- [A browser-based Photo booth application](github.com/nschoe), it is a small extension of the mirror view, it allows you to take pictures with your webcam and save them on disk.

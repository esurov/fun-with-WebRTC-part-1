# Let's Have Fun With WebRTC - Part 1
Code sample from my [first article about WebRTC](http://nschoe.com/articles/2015-02-14-Lets-Have-Fun-With-WebRTC-Part-1.html).  
You will find:

- [A simple mirror view](https://github.com/nschoe/fun-with-WebRTC-part-1/tree/master/1_mirror) to learn about the `MediaCapture` / `MediaStream` API and `getUserMedia()` function.
- [A browser-based Photo booth application](https://github.com/nschoe/fun-with-WebRTC-part-1/tree/master/1_1_photo_booth), it is a small extension of the mirror view, it allows you to take pictures with your webcam and save them on disk.
- [A Skype-like](https://github.com/nschoe/fun-with-WebRTC-part-1/tree/master/2_skype-like) application, to do peer-to-peer audio and video communication, in the browser, with no additional software or plugin.

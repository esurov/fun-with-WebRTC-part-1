# Simple Photo Booth
This simple piece of code is part of my [first article about WebRTC](http://nschoe.com/articles/2015-02-14-Lets-Have-Fun-With-WebRTC-Part-1.html).  
This is an extension of the Mirror View code sample, it shows how to create a Photo Booth (Mac) / Cheese (Linux)-like application, in the browser.

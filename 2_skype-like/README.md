# Let's Have Fun With WebRTC - Part 1
Code sample from my [first article about WebRTC](nschoe.com).  
This is a node.js implementation of a signalling server for WebRTC. It keeps track of the connected users, and generate unique tokens for the users to be called.

## Instructions
- First make sure you have nodejs and npm installed on the machine that will run the server.
- Then install "websockets" with `npm install websockets`
